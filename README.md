## What is Slidepad?  

**Slidepad** is a lightweight multitasking utility that merges the convenience of web browsing with the focus of native desktop tools. It replaces constant app-switching with a single, slide-in interface that keeps your essential web services and tools within immediate reach.  

When you slide in from the edge of your screen, Slidepad reveals a minimal workspace where you can open apps like Gmail, Notion, Figma, or Slack — all running smoothly within the same floating window. This lets you reply to a message, check a document, or reference data without interrupting your workflow.  

What makes Slidepad stand out is its *fluid interface design* and *context awareness*. It remembers your last session, supports drag-and-drop, and even keeps media or chats active while you work elsewhere. Each app runs independently inside the panel, reducing clutter and keeping your desktop organized.  

For professionals, designers, and developers, Slidepad functions as a **compact control hub** — ideal for managing communication, reference material, or online dashboards. Built natively for macOS, it supports **trackpad gestures, keyboard shortcuts, dark mode**, and full Apple Silicon optimization, ensuring both speed and stability in daily use.
